myPortfolio: Easy Way to Create Your Amazing Portfolio.
Description
Project objective& Background:
As a Full Stack Developer,  I have created a frontend for the myPortfolio application. In the third sprint, the scrum team agreed to develop the frontend of the application using an Angular framework. Since I have recently trained in working on this framework, i have chosen to lead this project and complete the initial part of the application. So i agree to complete this task as early as possible, as the release of the application is next week.
